.. warning:: **Developers:** Sort changes under appropriate heading
    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

New Features
------------

- :ref:`PowderDiffILLDetEffCorr <algm-PowderDiffILLDetEffCorr>` is extended to compute the detector efficiencies also for the 2-dimensional scanning diffractometer D2B at the ILL.


Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

- GSASIIRefineFitPeaks is now run asynchronously in the GUI, so the GSAS tab no longer locks when a refinement is run

:ref:`Release 3.13.0 <v3.13.0>`

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------

- New algorithm :ref:`LoadDNSSCD <algm-LoadDNSSCD>` to load multiple single crystal diffraction data files from the DNS instrument into MDEventWorkspace.

- :ref:`SaveLauenorm <algm-SaveLauenorm>` now has input options for crystal system and reflection condition for lscale output instead of trying to determine from lattice parameters.

Improvements
############

- PeaksWorkspace has column added for the unique peak number so peaks can be found after sorting or filtering.

- :ref:`StatisticsOfPeaksWorkspace <algm-StatisticsOfPeaksWorkspace>` has option to use a weighted Z score for determining which peaks are outliers and has a new output workspace for plotting intensities of equivalent peaks.
