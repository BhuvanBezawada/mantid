ISIS Reflectometry Interface
----------------------------

New features
############

- Two new boxes have been added to the settings tab of the ISIS Reflectometry interface, 'ReductionType' and 'SummationType' which are passed to the corresponding parameters of :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto`.
- The ISIS Reflectometry interface now has a checkbox 'CorrectDetectors' which maps to the corresponding property in :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto`.
- The 'Get Defaults' button now looks for values for the following additional properties in the IDF:
  - AnalysisMode
  - PolarizationAnalysis
  - TransRunStartOverlap
  - TransRunEndOverlap
  - IntegratedMonitors
  - DetectorCorrectionType
  - CorrectDetectors
  - SummationType
  - ReductionType

Improvements
############

- Grid lines are now displayed in the runs tab.
- Menu items and toolbar buttons are now enabled/disabled when appropriate, e.g. to prevent table modification during processing. Directly editing table rows and settings is also disabled during processing.
- Removed the 'DirectBeam' box from the settings tab of the ISIS Reflectometry interface because this is not used.
- Properties on the Runs tab now take precedence over properties on the Settings tab.
- Output workspace names have been improved. Names now use '+' to indicate preprocessed (i.e. summed) workspaces, rather than '_', which is used to indicate postprocessed (i.e. stitched) workspaces.
- The Python code generated when you tick `Output Notebook` has been improved to support special characters (e.g. `+`) in workspace names. Output workspaces are now set using the output properties of the algorithm rather than by variable assignment. This avoids the possibility of invalid characters being used in Python variable names.
- Added a new `?` button to the ISIS Reflectometry Interface which links to the documentation page.
- Added extra tooltips to the ISIS Reflectometry Interface.


Bug fixes
#########

- Fixed some bugs where transmission runs entered on the Settings tab were not being found, whether entered as a run number to load or as the name of an existing workspace in the ADS.
- The Python code generated when you tick `Output Notebook` has been changed so that all algorithm property values are enclosed in quotes. Unquoted values were causing failures in some algorithms. A bug has also been fixed in setting the legend location for the 4th (stitched) plot, which is shown when post-processing is performed.
- If any of the mandatory parameters listed below are missing when pressing 'Get Default' a warning is shown rather than a crash.
  - MonitorIntegralMax
  - MonitorIntegralMin
  - MonitorBackgroundMin,
  - MonitorBackgroundMax,
  - LambdaMin,
  - LambdaMax,
  - I0MonitorIndex
  - TransRunStartOverlap and TransRunEndOverlap if on SURF or CRISP.

Features Removed
################

* The REFL Reduction, REFL SF Calculator and REFM Reduction graphical interface have been removed, they were not in active use, and were a source of bugs as well as using testing effort that is better directed elsewhere.

Algorithms
----------

New features
############

- The new algorithm :ref:`algm-PolarizationEfficiencyCor` corrects for efficiencies in polarization analysis.
- The new algorithm :ref:`algm-LoadILLPolarizationFactors` can load the polarization efficiency files used on D17 at ILL.
- The new algorithm :ref:`algm-MRInspectData` takes in raw event data and determines reduction parameters.
- The new algorithm :ref:`algm-MRFilterCrossSections` loads a MR (SNS) data file into a workspace group comprising of a workspace for each cross-section.


Improvements
############

- Removed the ``RegionOfDirectBeam`` property from :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` and :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` because this is not used.
- Improvements to :ref:`algm-LoadILLReflectometry`:
  - Figaro NeXus files are now properly handled.
  - A new property, *BeamCentre* allows user to manually specify the beam position on the detector.
  - The *BeamPosition* property was renamed to *DirectBeamPosition* to better reflect its usage.
  - The *BraggAngle* property of :ref:`algm-LoadILLReflectometry` now works as expected: the detector will be rotated such that the reflected peak on the detector will be at twice *BraggAngle*.
  - Slits S2 and S3 have been added to D17 and Figaro IDFs; the loader will adjust their positions according to the NeXus files.
  - The MagnetismReflectometryReduction now computes a Q-resolution estimate based on slit openings.
