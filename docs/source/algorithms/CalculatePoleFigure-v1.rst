This algorithm is intended to calculate pole figure from engineering material.


Pole Figure
###########

In engineering material science, material is measured from different laboratory coodinates.
It is necessary to transform the laboratory coordiante to sample coordinate.

Pole figure plots a specific peak's intensity in the sample coordinate.
